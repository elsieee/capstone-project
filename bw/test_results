## Benchmark tests



For a newtork with 3 intersections:

Test 1:

for cycle in range(20,121,20) and
for gi0, go0, gi1, go1, gi2, go2  in range(0,cycle, int(cycle/5)):

	max_cost = 121.37142857061225

	[cycle, gi0, go0, gi1, go1, gi2, go2] = [120, 96, 72, 96, 96, 96, 96]





The following tests are for a network with 2 intersections:


Test 2:


for cycle in range(90,601,10) and
for gi0, go0, gi1, go1  in range(0,cycle, int(cycle/3)):

	 max_cost = 1126.6285303908385

	[cycle, gi0, go0, gi1, go1] = [590, 588, 588, 588, 588]


Test 3: 

for cycle in range(20,121,20) and
for gi0, go0, gi1, go1  in range(0,cycle, int(cycle/3)):
